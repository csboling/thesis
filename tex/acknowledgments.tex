\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\DoubleSpacing
I am especially thankful for the tremendous support of my family and
loved ones throughout my time at school. In particular, I want to
express my appreciation for Paula, whose patience, feedback, and
reassurance have been invaluable in much more than just my academic work.

The software described in this thesis would not have been possible to
realize without the benefit of many prolonged design discussions with
student researchers Ian Bacus and Yousef Gtat, and I am tremendously
grateful for their input and development support. Furthermore, the
entire AMSaC lab has been a great help and a fine community to work in
the last few years.

This work was partially supported by funding from NIH grant
1R01ES022302.
